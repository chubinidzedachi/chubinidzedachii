    James played basketball for St.Vincent-St.Mary High School in his hometown of Akron,Ohio,and was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar.A prep-to-pro,he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft.Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year,he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010.After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat;this was announced in the television special The Decision and is among the most controversial free-agent decisions in sports history.
